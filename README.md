So this is my dissertation latex code. There's a bug in the template that I have yet to figure out. SO when you compile it will complain. Just hit enter a bunch of times and it will actually build just fine. Still very much a work in progress. 

the command to build is 


latekmk --pdf markenDissertation.tex
