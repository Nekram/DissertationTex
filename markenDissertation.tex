%% here's where things get a little weird. In order to put "Page" at the top of every page of the ToC (LoF, etc.), we
%	have to spoof a ToC entry that just says "Page". This is how you do it. Put one before the Intro, so that it's
%	ready to go on Page 2 (Page 1 of each of the ToC, LoF, etc. is already taken care of).
